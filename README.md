# Cursor Settings extension for VS Code

## Features

- Quick cursor customization: Change your **cursor style**, **cursor blinking**, and **cursor width** by clicking on the "**Cursor**" (it will open a menu with options to quickly adjust the cursor).

- Enhanced Comfort: Create a coding environment that's tailored to your visual preferences, promoting a more comfortable coding experience.

- Boosted Efficiency: Quickly customize your cursor settings without opening the **Settings tab** or `settings.json`, allowing you to focus and change the appearance of the cursor to fit your mood and task.

- It won't change your favorite theme cursor color.

I hope you find this extension useful.
